     Privacy Policy – Safer Choice
Last Updated: February 13, 2026
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how Danilo Dimic, doing business as Safer Choice (“we,” “us,” or “our”), collects, uses, stores, and shares your personal information when you use our mobile application Safer Choice (“App”) or related services (collectively, “Services”). This Policy is designed to provide full transparency and legal protection regarding the processing of user data.
By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
1. Information We Collect
1.1 Personal Information You Provide
We may collect information you voluntarily provide, including:
Account identifiers: username, phone number, email address
Friend interactions: requests, approvals, messaging, alarms
Device identifiers: for push notifications and FCM registration
Emergency contacts: phone numbers used for SMS alerts when using the Panic Button
1.2 Device and App Usage Information
Local audio processing: The App may process audio locally to detect emergency situations. No audio is transmitted externally except for triggering in-app alarms and messages to other users.
Background and foreground activity: The App may process minimal information while running in the foreground or background to ensure proper operation of safety features.
FCM codes: For push notifications, the App may generate unique codes to manage messaging between users.
SMS sending: The App may send SMS messages automatically or on user activation of the Panic Button to pre-designated emergency contacts, including an optional 8-digit verification or alert code.
1.3 Third-Party Services
Currently, the App uses:
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): for delivering notifications, friend requests, alarms, and messages. We do not collect additional analytics or personal data via Firebase.
Telephony services: For sending SMS alerts to designated contacts. We do not store message content beyond operational logs for delivery purposes.
2. How We Use Your Information
We process your data for the following purposes:
To provide and maintain our Services – e.g., push notifications, alarms, emergency alerts, friend requests, messaging.
To protect user safety – processing audio locally to detect screams or emergency words (“help”) and triggering alerts.
Emergency communication: Sending SMS alerts automatically when the Panic Button is activated, including the location and pre-defined emergency messages to designated contacts.
To communicate with users – sending FCM codes, friend requests, messages, and alarms.
To improve the App – troubleshooting, technical support, and operational monitoring.
We process your data only when there is a legitimate purpose, such as fulfilling contractual obligations, protecting vital interests, or with your consent.
3. Legal Basis for Processing
Where applicable (e.g., EU, UK, California, other privacy regimes), we rely on:
Consent: Explicit consent for notifications, messaging, SMS sending, and emergency alerts.
Contractual necessity: Providing App services, friend requests, alarms, and Panic Button notifications.
Vital interests: Protecting user safety during emergencies.
Legitimate interests: Ensuring App functionality, security, and troubleshooting.
4. Data Storage and Security
All audio processing occurs locally on your device; we do not transmit audio externally.
SMS messages are sent directly to designated contacts via the device’s telephony services; content is not stored outside operational logs.
Minimal data (FCM tokens, friend IDs) are stored temporarily on secure servers to enable messaging and alarms.
We implement industry-standard technical and organizational safeguards to protect user data.
However, no system is completely secure; you acknowledge that there is always some risk of unauthorized access.
5. Data Sharing
We may share information only in the following situations:
Service providers: Limited to third-party providers necessary to operate messaging, notifications, and SMS services (e.g., FCM, telephony operators).
Business transfers: In the event of mergers, acquisitions, or sale of assets.
Other users: Friend interactions, messaging, alarms, and SMS alerts are visible to selected users per your consent.
We do not sell personal information to third parties for commercial purposes.
6. International Data Transfers
Your data may be stored or processed in countries outside your residence, including countries without equivalent privacy laws. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information.
7. Retention
We retain personal information only as long as necessary for operational purposes or legal obligations. Upon deletion of your account, associated data is removed or anonymized.
8. User Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
Access, correct, or delete your personal data
Withdraw consent for processing
Restrict processing or object to it
Lodge a complaint with a relevant supervisory authority
To exercise these rights, contact: danilodimic07@gmail.com
9. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for users under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
10. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Policy to reflect legal changes or App modifications. The “Last Updated” date will indicate the latest revision. We encourage reviewing this Policy regularly.
